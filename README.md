\# Student Academic Risk Prediction



\## Project Overview

This project predicts whether a student is academically at risk using machine learning.

The model is trained using attendance percentage, study hours, and previous exam scores.



\## Technologies Used

\- Python

\- Pandas

\- Scikit-learn

\- Logistic Regression



\## Features

\- Custom dataset creation

\- Model training and accuracy evaluation

\- Saving trained model using Pickle

\- Loading saved model for prediction without retraining



\## How to Run

1\. Install dependencies:

&nbsp;  pip install pandas scikit-learn



2\. Train the model:

&nbsp;  python train\_model.py



3\. Predict for a new student:

&nbsp;  python predict\_student.py



\## Output

The system predicts whether a student is \*\*AT RISK\*\* or \*\*NOT AT RISK\*\*.
